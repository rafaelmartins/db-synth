TITLE: Build From Sources
-------------------------
To build the firmware from sources, we need an AVR toolchain with support for the AVR DB series.
Linux users can download it from [[https://github.com/rafaelmartins/avr-toolchain/releases/latest]].
Just extract it somewhere and add the full `avr/bin` folder path to your `PATH` variable.
[`cmake`](https://cmake.org/) is also required.

    $ git clone https://github.com/rafaelmartins/db-synth.git
    $ mkdir -p db-synth/build
    $ cd db-synth/build
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../firmware
    $ make

This will create the `db-synth.elf`, `db-synth.hex` and `db-synth-fuse.hex` files.
