----------
A `MIDI`-controlled mono-voice digital synthesizer built on top of the AVR DB
microcontroller series.

### Why?!

I've been playing around the design of synthesizers (both analog and digital) for
some time, and I'm a long time AVR user. When I noticed that Microchip released
a new [AVR DB series]
(https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/microcontrollers-and-microprocessors/8-bit-mcus/avr-mcus/avr-db),
that included internal `DAC`s and operational amplifiers, building a digital
synthesizer out of that was the only obvious thing to do! :D


### Features

This synthesizer implements a single but reasonably capable voice, with the
following modules:

Band-limited oscillator (tracks most of the `MIDI` note range, with decent
tracking up to 8th octave):

* Square (*not* Pulse)
* Sine
* Triangle
* Saw

ADSR envelope generator (time parameters from 20ms to 20s, emulating `AS3310`):

* Linear curves
* Exponential curves (emulating `AS3310`)

Other features include:

* 48kHz/10bit sample rate.
* Fully controllable via `MIDI`.
* Current settings can be stored into the internal `EEPROM` as a preset.
* Second order reconstruction filter for signal output.
* `OLED` display for parameter monitoring.
